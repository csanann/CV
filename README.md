## Chayada Sansiriwong

I have a strong background in healthcare and molecular science, which has sparked my interest in using technology, specifically Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), big data and finance, to enhance human health. To pursue this passion, I completed a Software Developer course at Makers and a Data Science, acquiring the necessary skills to transition into the tech world.

In light of my role as a software developer, I have come to acknowledge the necessity for additional hands-on experience to enhance my proficiency. I am eager to delve into diverse industries, seeking opportunities that will enable me to sharpen my skills while simultaneously making meaningful contributions to the development of impactful applications that mutually benefit the organisation and foster my own professional growth.
