## Chayada Sansiriwong

I am a driven software engineer with a passion for leveraging technology to enhance lives. Transitioning from healthcare and science roles into tech through immersive tech training programs like Makers and HyperionDev co-Nottingham University, I recognise technologyâ€™s potential for meaningful impact. My background in research has honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. Skilled in full-stack and cloud development, I crave opportunities to collaborate on human-centric solutions. I am eager to join a company where technology drives positive change, meeting clients' needs and creating happier users.

During my training time at Makers Academy, I honed several essential soft skills and transferable skills:
- Adaptive: I quickly adapted to a fast-paced and ever-evolving tech evolving tech environment, continously embracing new programming languages and frameworks as part of our immersive curriculum.
- Positive Attitude: I consistently maintained a positive and can-do attitude, even when facing challenging coding projects and tight deadlines.
- Resilience: Overcoming coding setbacks and debugging challenges was a constant part of our learning process, and I eagerly accepted each hurdle as an opportunity for growth.
- Eager Learner: My strong desire to learn and proactive develop new skills led me to explore various programming languages and frameworks, such as Ruby, JavaScript, React and more.
- Effective Comunicator: My experiences in pair programming, daily standups, retro-session and Agile methodologies enriched my communication skills and allowed me to effectively collaborate with diverse teams.
- Leadership: Through project work and workshops, I had the chance to gain valuable real-world experience in emotional intelligence, empathy, teamwork, and mentoring. Our collective goal was to grow professinally as a team.
- Problem-Solving: My background in healthcare and science roles, combined with rigorous project work, has honed my analytical thinking and enhanced my problem-solving abilities. I learned to approach challenges from different perspectives and find creative solutions.
