## Chayada Sansiriwong

Coming from a healthcare background with a specialization in molecular science, I have developed a deep passion for using Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and big data to enhance human health. My experiences in various healthcare settings have showcased the transformative power of technology, particularly in its potential to bring about positive change in the healthcare industry and beyond.

This understanding has sparked my interest in utilizing cloud services like AWS to analyze molecular markers or genetics data. The goal is to leverage these technologies to predict treatments and nutritional needs, thereby directly contributing to improving and preserving human health.

Driven by these experiences and insights, I am eager to transition into the tech industry and embark on a new journey. To ensure that I stay relevant and continuously grow, I recently completed a Software Developer course at Makers after completing a Data Science bootcamp. Currently, I am actively working on enhancing my programming skills.

My passion lies in simplifying complex problems and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in technology. My unique background and diverse experiences enable me to provide valuable insights to organizations. I am excited to pursue a fulfilling career in software development, leveraging my skill-set to make a meaningful impact in the field.
