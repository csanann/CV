## Chayada Sansiriwong

I am a junior software developer with a background in healthcare and molecular science. I am passionate about using technology to improve human quality of life. I believe that AGI and big data have the potential to transform our lives, making them more efficient, effective and convenient. I am excited to gain more hands-on experience in diverse industries to develop impactful applications that benefit both the organisation and my professional growth.

I am interested in developing AI-powered tools that can help people automate tasks and make better decisions. I believe that big data analytics platforms can be used to provide personalised recommendations for products, services and information. Ultimately, I want to use my skills, knowledge and experience to make a positive impact on human quality of life.
